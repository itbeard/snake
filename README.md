The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the game board.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state.

4. `Controller`: This class will handle the user input. It will have methods to process the arrow keys.

5. `View`: This class will handle the game display. It will have methods to draw the game board, the snake, and the food.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

`main.py`
